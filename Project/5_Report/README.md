# Fire Alarm System 
## Introduction
In this project, we are going to create a fire alert system using ATMEGA8 microcontroller and fire sensor. Fire sensors can be of any type, here fire sensor play a vital role we have different types of fire alarms
we can use any one with respect to your project here i am using LM35 a temperature sensor when temperature level exceed the actual level fire sensor sent signal to
microcontroller then buzzer rings after that we reset the buzzer using and fire sensor using reset button, we can use this in real time environments like hospitals schools and shopping malls etc..
we are going to install the fire sensor on the servo motor. The survey will rotate the 180 degree pendulum. With the fire sensor mounted on it, we get 270+ degree fire sensing vision. The survey will continue to rotate, thus providing a complete room fire alert system. We can add smoke sensors to the system for more accuracy. With it we can achieve high accuracy.

### Where
 * Fire alarm system is use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls etc..

### When
* Fire alarm is activated when it temperature level exceed to normal level it buzzer is activated
* buzzer is activated throught micro controller atmega8

### What
* fire alarm system using microcontroller Atmega8 and fire sensor, here fire sensor play a vital role

### Who 
*  Fire alarm system is use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls they are used this

### How
* Fire alarm is independent device it not dependent on external user it work on micro controller

# High Level Requirements
|HLR|     Description  |
|------|  --------------|
|HLR_1|   it shall be sense the fire.
|HLR_2|   it shall be make sound when fire senses .
|HLR_3|   it shall have reset button to reset buzzer.
|HLR_4|   it shall have ADC to sense analog signals.
#            
# Low Level Requirements
|ID|     Low Level Requirements for HL1 |  |ID|       Low Level Requirements for HL2 |
|------|  ------------|--|---|   ----------------|
|LLR1|  it shall have fire sensor.|  |LLR1|     it shall have a buzzer to connect.            
|LLR2|  it shall have ADC.|  |LLR2|   it shall have a sensor to connect.

#
|ID|     Low Level Requirements for HL3 |  |ID|       Low Level Requirements for HL4 |
|------|  ------------|--|---|   ----------------|
|LLR1|   we shall reset button manually .|  |H4L1|     It shall have interrupt .            
|LLR2|  Reset button is connect buzzer.|  |LLR2|   it shall have a ADC, to covert signals .
