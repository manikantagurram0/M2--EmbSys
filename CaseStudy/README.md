# Fire Alarm System 
## Introduction
I am going to make a fire alarm system using microcontroller Atmega8 and fire sensor, here fire sensor play a vital role we have different types of fire alarms
we can use any one with respect to your project here i am using LM35 a temperature sensor when temperature level exceed the actual level fire sensor sent signal to
microcontroller then buzzer rings after that we reset the buzzer using and fire sensor using reset button, we can use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls etc..

### Where
 * Fire alarm system is use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls etc..

### When
* Fire alarm is activated when it temperature level exceed to normal level it buzzer is activated
* buzzer is activated throught micro controller atmega8

### What
* fire alarm system using microcontroller Atmega8 and fire sensor, here fire sensor play a vital role

### Who 
*  Fire alarm system is use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls they are used this

### How
* Fire alarm is independent device it not dependent on external user it work on micro controller

# High Level Requirements
|HLR|     Description  |
|------|  --------------|
|HLR_1|   it work when fire detected.
|HLR_2|   buzzer will strat work when fire is detects .
|HLR_3|   we need to reset buzzer after work done.
|HLR_4|   fire alarm  need to work perfectl .
#            
# Low Level Requirements
|ID|     Low Level Requirements for HL1 |  |ID|       Low Level Requirements for HL2 |
|------|  ------------|--|---|   ----------------|
|H1L1|   fire sensor is needed.|  |H2L1|     buzzer should connect to microcontroller.            
|H1L2|  Then  buzzer is operated.|  |H2L2|   buzzer is connects to servo motor.

#
|ID|     Low Level Requirements for HL3 |  |ID|       Low Level Requirements for HL4 |
|------|  ------------|--|---|   ----------------|
|H3L1|   buzzer is need to reset manually.|  |H4L1|     microcontroller is need to install perfectly .            
|H3L1|  so reset butoon is needed.|  |H4L1|   program the microcontroller to perform operation.

## components used in fire alarm

### power supply
 * it is used give power supply to circuit

### Servo motor (sg90)
 * it have connected with fire sensor it rotate acording to temparature pressure 

### ATMEGA8
 * it is used to control the all circuit and send commands and operate buzzer

### BUZZER
 * Buzzer is used to make sound and it a output to the circuit

### Button
 * it is used to set and reset buzzer
 
 
 

 ##### 10KΩ resistor, 1KΩ resistor, 220Ω resistor, 100nF capacitor.

# Micro Oven
## An oven is a small electric kitchen appliance designed to heat or bake a variety of products. Its design has undergone many changes, from purely mechanical to automatic, with some subtlety.

#### magnitron
 * This piece of microwave receives the high voltage supplied by the transformer and converts it into microwave energy to heat the food.

#### Heating element 
 * The heating element converts electrical energy into heat.
