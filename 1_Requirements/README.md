I am going to make a fire alarm system using microcontroller Atmega8 and fire sensor, here fire sensor play a vital role we have different types of fire alarms
we can use any one with respect to your project here i am using LM35 a temperature sensor when temperature level exceed the actual level fire sensor sent signal to
microcontroller then buzzer rings after that we reset the buzzer using and fire sensor using reset button, we can use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls etc..


components used in fire alarm

*power supply
 it is used give power supply to circuit

*Servo motor (sg90)
it have connected with fire sensor it rotate acording to temparature pressure 

*ATMEGA8
it is used to control the all circuit and send commands and operate buzzer

*BUZZER
Buzzer is used to make sound and it a output to the circuit

*Button
it is used to set and reset buzzer

10KΩ resistor, 1KΩ resistor, 220Ω resistor, 100nF capacitor.
