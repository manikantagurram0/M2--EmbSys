# Introduction
I am going to make a fire alarm system using microcontroller Atmega8 and fire sensor, here fire sensor play a vital role we have different types of fire alarms
we can use any one with respect to your project here i am using LM35 a temperature sensor when temperature level exceed the actual level fire sensor sent signal to
microcontroller then buzzer rings after that we reset the buzzer using and fire sensor using reset button, we can use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls etc..


## 4W'S AND 1H

### Where
 * Fire alarm system is use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls etc..

### When
* Fire alarm is activated when it temperature level exceed to normal level it buzzer is activated
* buzzer is activated throught micro controller atmega8

### What
* fire alarm system using microcontroller Atmega8 and fire sensor, here fire sensor play a vital role

### Who 
*  Fire alarm system is use this in real time environments like hospitals
schools and shopping malls they are used this

### How
* Fire alarm is independent device it not dependent on external user it work on micro controller

# High Level Requirements
|HLR|     Description  |
|------|  --------------|
|HLR_1|   it work when fire detected.
|HLR_2|   buzzer will strat work whenfire is detects .
|HLR_3|   we need to reset buzzer after work done.
|HLR_4|   fire alarm  need to work perfectly .
            
# Low Level Requirements
|LLR|     Description |
|------|  ------------|
|LLR_1|   fire sensor is needed.
|LLR_2|   buzzer is need and connects to microcontroller.
|LLR_3|   reset button is need to install.
|LLR_4|   microcontroller need to install.

## components used in fire alarm

### power supply
 * it is used give power supply to circuit

### Servo motor (sg90)
 * it have connected with fire sensor it rotate acording to temparature pressure 

### ATMEGA8
 * it is used to control the all circuit and send commands and operate buzzer

### BUZZER
 * Buzzer is used to make sound and it a output to the circuit

### Button
 * it is used to set and reset buzzer
 
 
 

 ##### 10KΩ resistor, 1KΩ resistor, 220Ω resistor, 100nF capacitor.
